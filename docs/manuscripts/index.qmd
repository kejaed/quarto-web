## What is a Quarto Manuscript?

Quarto provides a framework for writing and publishing your scholarly articles. You can write your article content in a format you already use (`.ipynb` or `.qmd`), and can easily include computations, entire computational notebooks, data or other resources. Quarto produces a manuscript website for you that includes an HTML version of your article, additional formats for your article, like PDF and Word documents, rendered versions of computational notebooks, and an archive of all of this content suitable for submission to a journal.

On this page, you'll get an overview of what a Quarto manuscript is. If you're ready to try it out yourself, skip down to [get started](#get-started).

## Manuscript Output

You can see an example of Quarto's manuscript output at the website generated from our template repository at <https://cwickham.github.io/manuscript-template/>.

::: callout-tip
The template is a version of the [Notebooks Now! Quarto Lite example](https://notebooks-now.github.io/submission-quarto-lite/) simplified for this tutorial. While the template demonstrates many of the features of Quarto, if you'd like to see them in a more realistic article structure you might explore the original version.
:::

The article itself appears as the content of the webpage, and can include all the elements common to scholarly writing like figures, tables, equations, cross references and citations.

![Navigation](images/webpage-menu.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the menu on the right hand side of the manuscript webpage. The menu has headings: Table of contents, Other Formats, Notebooks and Other Links." .border}

:::

On the right, you'll see navigation: a table of contents for the article itself followed by links to **Other Formats**, **Notebooks** and **Other Links**.

Other Formats

:   These links allow a reader to download alternative formats of your article. In this example, there is a Word version that may be useful for a reviewer to provide feedback, and a PDF version that uses the American Geophysical Union's (AGU) template. Additionally, there is a MECA archive, a zip file that is designed to capture your article and its supporting documents into a single file suitable for sending to a publisher. You can read more about MECA archives in ADD LINK.

Notebooks

:   These are links to notebooks included in the manuscript. The "Article Notebook" is notebook version of the article itself. In this example, "Data Screening" is a notebook from which a single cell is embedded in the article. Any other notebooks that are included in the project, even if they are not directly used in the article will also appear here. 
    
    When a reader visits any of these notebook links, they view an HTML version of the notebook allowing them to view the code and output without leaving their browser. In addition, a link to download the notebook source is also provided.

The top of the page has a link Back to the Article, and a button to Download Notebook. The content of the page includes some text, and a cell displaying code."}
    
    

Other Links

:  Links that leave the manuscript webpage, for example to take a reader to the manuscript's GitHub Repo.



## Manuscript Source

As an author you produce the manuscript source that Quarto uses to produce the manuscript output. At its simplest, a Quarto manuscript project has two files:

-   A notebook file where you write your article. This file contains:
    -   document metadata including things like article front matter (authors, affiliations etc.) and Quarto options,
    -   the article body, written using special Quarto markdown syntax that allows you to add things like cross references and citations, and
    -   optionally, code, where you control if, or how, the code and its output appear in the article.
-   A configuration file `_quarto.yml` that identifies the project as a Quarto manuscript and controls how your manuscript is put together.

A manuscript project will often contain other files: some that add additional resources to the manuscript itself like figures, notebooks or bibliographic data; and some that are specific to manuscript workflow like Git or GitHub settings.

## Manuscript Workflow

The process of writing a Quarto manuscript involves editing the manuscript source, using Quarto to preview the manuscript output, and publishing the output to the web. If you're ready to try out this workflow yourself, continue to Get Started.

## Get Started {#get-started}

### Install Quarto {#install}

Manuscripts are a new feature in Quarto 1.4. Before you get started, install the pre-release version of Quarto.

{{< include ../download/_download-pre.md >}}

### Choose Your Tool {#choose}

You can author Quarto manuscripts:

* in any tool that can edit notebooks, 
* in an `.ipynb` or `.qmd` file,
* with computations in Python, R, Julia or Observable.

However, we've written our tutorial for the most common combinations. Choose you path to start learning how to author Quarto manuscripts:
