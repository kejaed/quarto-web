As we mentioned in the [Overview](../index.qmd), a Quarto manuscript consists of at least two files: a notebook where you write your article, and a configuration file `_quarto.yml`. As a {{< meta tool.name >}} user, we recommend you write your article in a notebook called `{{< meta tool.article-file >}}`.

This particular manuscript project includes some other files and folders, some of which are common in any project hosted on GitHub: `.github/`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`; and others are specific to this manuscript: `_extensions/`, `images/`, `notebooks/`, and `references.bib`. You'll learn about these manuscript specific files as you work through this authoring page.
